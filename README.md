# T3 Code

T3 Code is a minimal web GUI for coding agents made by [Pingdotgg](https://github.com/pingdotgg). This project is a downstream fork of the original [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code), maintained in [aaditagrawal/t3code](https://github.com/aaditagrawal/t3code).

This fork focuses on expanding provider support, improving persistence layers, and refining provider management across the app.

It supports Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI, Amp, Kilo, and OpenCode.

(NOTE: Amp /mode free is not supported, as Amp Code doesn't support it in headless mode - since they need to show ads for that business model to work.)

## Why this fork?

This fork aims to provide a more robust and feature-rich multi-provider experience, with improved server management, more reliable persistence of orchestration events, and UI refinements for settings and model selection.

### Multi-provider support (Enhanced)

Adds full provider adapters (server managers, service layers, runtime layers) for agents that are not yet on the upstream roadmap:

| Provider    | What's included                                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gemini CLI  | **Enhanced:** Adapter + `geminiCliServerManager` with full test coverage  |
| Amp         | Adapter + `ampServerManager` for headless Amp sessions                    |
| Copilot     | Adapter + CLI binary resolution + text generation layer                   |
| Cursor      | Adapter + ACP probe integration + usage tracking                          |
| Kilo        | Adapter + `kiloServerManager` + OpenCode-style server URL config          |
| OpenCode    | Adapter + `opencodeServerManager` with hostname/port/workspace config     |
| Claude Code | Full adapter with permission mode, thinking token limits, and SDK typings |

### Persistence & Orchestration Improvements

- **Normalized Provider Kinds:** Migration added to handle legacy provider kind naming consistently.
- **Improved Event Store:** Robust persistence layer for orchestration events with better error handling.
- **Session Management:** refined `ProviderSessionDirectory` for better tracking of active sessions.

### UX enhancements

| Feature             | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Settings page       | Dedicated route (`/settings`) for theme, accent color, and custom model slug configuration |
| Accent color system | Preset palette with contrast-safe terminal color injection across the entire UI            |
| Theme support       | Light / dark / system modes with transition suppression                                    |
| Command palette     | `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` palette for quick actions, script running, and thread navigation        |
| Sidebar search      | Normalized thread title search with instant filtering                                      |
| Plan sidebar        | Dedicated panel for reviewing, downloading, or saving proposed agent plans                 |
| Terminal drawer     | Theme-aware integrated terminal with accent color styling                                  |

## Getting started

### Quick install (recommended)

Run the interactive installer — it detects your OS, checks prerequisites (git, Node.js ≥ 24, bun ≥ 1.3.9), installs missing tools, and lets you choose between development/production and desktop/web builds:

```bash
# macOS / Linux / WSL
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaditagrawal/t3code/main/scripts/install.sh)
```

```powershell
# Windows (Git Bash, MSYS2, or WSL)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaditagrawal/t3code/main/scripts/install.sh)
```

### Manual build

> [!WARNING]
> You need at least one supported coding agent installed and authorized. See the supported agents list below.

```bash
# Prerequisites: Bun >=1.3.9, Node >=24.13.1
git clone https://github.com/aaditagrawal/t3code.git
cd t3code
bun install
bun run dev
```
